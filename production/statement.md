Design Statement

Born in Shenzhen, China, I live, study, and work in New York, Shenzhen, Tokyo and Shanghai. Currently I’m pursing my bachelor’s degree of Design and Technology from Parsons School of Design.

Working as a milinery designer for five years, traditional craft and its sincere way of expression are an inseparable part of my design. Though those craftsmanship are always the most heart-touching elements of my work, I’m still in the exploration of connecting them with modern technology. 

My inspiration often comes from the very subtle corners from my life and from the world I see. For me, creating artwork is a process of self-rapprochement. Listening to, being sensible and sensitive, and paying attention to a variety of entities bring to my work through the medium of fashion products, sculptures, photography and web designs.
